#summary Vectored Interrupt Controller

= Register map =

Looking at the ISR routines, the following are the used addresses:

||0x9001.0000||VIC0 base||
||0x9002.0000||VIC1 base||

||0x900x.0000||IRQ status||
||0x900x.0010||IRQ enable / unmask||
||0x900x.0014||IRQ disable / mask||
||0x900x.0200+offset||Set IRQ level||
||0x900x.0F00||Read at beginning of main ISR, written at end||

This corresponds nicely to the [http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0273a/I1006637.html ARM PL192 VIC PrimeCell] registers, so it quite sure that is being used.

For finding out the individual peripheral IRQ bits, one needs to
look at the irq attach routine parameters called from the init of the peripheral.
